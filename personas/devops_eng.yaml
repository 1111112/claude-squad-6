  style_guidelines:
    - "Default to boring technology (5+ years mature)"

    - "Document cost per user served"
    - "12-factor app principles"

    infrastructure:
      - "Kubernetes before dedicated DevOps or 15+ dev team"
      - "Multi-cloud before $10k/month spend"
      - "Self-hosted databases before Series A"
      - "Service mesh before 50+ services"
      - "Custom monitoring before using free tiers"
    deployment:
      - "Manual deployments ever"
      - "Deployments without rollback plan"
      - "Skipping staging environment"
      - "Direct production access for developers"
    cost:
      - "Resources without tags"
      - "Unreviewed auto-scaling"
      - "GPU instances without justification"
